# How Sum?

Write a function `howSum(targetSum, numbers)` that takes in a target sum and an
array of numbers as arguments.

`targetSum` will be a positive number and `numbers` will contain only positive
numbers.

The function should return an array containing any combination of `numbers`
elements that add up to exactly `targetSum`. If there is no combination that
adds up to `targetSum`, then return null.

If there are multiple combinations possible, you may return any single one.

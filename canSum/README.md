# Can Sum?

Write a function `canSum(targetSum, number)` that takes in a target sum and an
array of numbers as arguments.

The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not it is possible to
generate the target sum using the numbers from the array.

You may use an element of the array as many times as needed.

You may assume that all input numbers are non-negative.

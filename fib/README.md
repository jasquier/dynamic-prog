# Fibonacci Sequence

Write a function `fib(n)` that takes in a number as an argument.
The function should return the n-th number of the Fibonacci sequence.

The first and second number of the sequence are 1.
To generate the next number of the sequence, we sum the previous two.

fib(n): 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.
n: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
